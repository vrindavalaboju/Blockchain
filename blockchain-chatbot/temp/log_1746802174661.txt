Response: Common symptoms of the common cold include:
• Runny or stuffy nose
• Sore throat
• Coughing
• Sneezing
• Mild headache

• Mild body aches

These symptoms typically develop 1-3 days after exposure to a cold virus and can last for 7-10 days. The common cold is caused by various viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common.

Treatment is generally focused on relieving symptoms through rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter medications as needed. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like the common cold.
